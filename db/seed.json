He conveys such universality through a unique deconstructed approach in bringing the Arabic script to life.Born and raised in London, Aadil has painted for renowned figures such as Hollywood actor Riz Ahmed, HUDA Beauty founders and Bollywood royalty Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. He has collaborated with modest fashion house 'VERONA Collections' and his work was featured in ABC's NCIS series.",
